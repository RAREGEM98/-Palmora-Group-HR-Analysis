# -Palmora-Group-HR-Analysis
This project explores gender-related issues within Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company in Nigeria, recently under scrutiny for gender inequality across its 3 operational regions.
As part of a data-driven HR initiative, I was engaged as an HR Analytics expert to uncover insights from internal employee data—focusing on:
-Gender distribution across departments and regions
-Gender pay gap analysis
-Regional disparities in pay and representation
-Salary band segmentation and compliance with new wage regulations

## Main Questions Answered
1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and
departments
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If
there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of
management
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay
employees a minimum of $90,000
● Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
● Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example:
● How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000,
etc.?
● Also visualize this by regions
5. Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees
● Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of
bonus)
● Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide

### Analyzed data

### Key Insights
1. **Gender Distribution Disparity**
-Male employees significantly outnumber female employees across all three regions.
-Some departments and regions (notably in Manufacturing and Engineering) have negligible female representation.

2. **Gender Pay Gap**
-There is a notable difference in average salaries between male and female employees in most departments.
-The gap is more pronounced in technical roles and management positions.

3. **Regional Salary Compliance**
-A new regulation requires a minimum salary of $90,000 for manufacturing employees.
-Certain regions and roles still fall below the threshold, exposing the company to compliance risk.

4. **Salary Distribution Insights**
-Most employees fall in the $70,000–$90,000 band.
-Fewer employees occupy higher salary bands ($110,000+), and those are predominantly male.

5. **Rating Trends by Gender**
-Ratings given to male employees are slightly higher on average.

### Recommendations 
1. **Address Gender Representation Gaps**
-Launch targeted recruitment and outreach in underrepresented departments.
-Implement mentorship programs to retain and support female employees.

2. **Conduct Pay Equity Audit**
-Investigate and adjust salary bands to close unjustified gender-based pay gaps.
-Introduce transparent pay structures.

3. **Ensure Regulatory Compliance**
-Prioritize salary reviews units below the $90,000 minimum threshold.
-Consider implementing region-based salary floor checks in HR policy.

4. **Promote Inclusive Culture**
-Conduct gender sensitivity and unconscious bias training across all regions.
-Establish DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) performance indicators for managers.

5. **Ongoing Monitoring with Dashboards**
-Leverage Power BI dashboards to track:
  Gender ratios
  Salary bands
  Departmental/regional variations
  Rating fairness and review cycles
